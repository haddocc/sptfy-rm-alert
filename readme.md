# Spotify Removal Alert

This piece of code is aimed at tracking your liked tracks of Spotify and notify you whenever they silently remove a track because of legal reasons or ending contracts.

It is meant to deploy to a cloud-based service like Heroku or Google Cloud f.e. so you don't have to keep your local machine running at all times.

This is a work in progress, so please be patient ;-)

# Setup

I like to store an alias to `bin/console` so if you agree this might come in handy please add `alias c="php bin/console"` to either `.bash_profile`, `.bash_rc`, `.zshrc`, or `.zsh_profile`
